I am a very passionate person who aims to make a difference in the world. I use my critical thinking skills to guide see through obstacles that present themselves in work settings and personal life. I'm a problem solver by nature and this makes me a pleasure to work with in collaborative settings as well as producing quality work independently. My personality trait is an advocate so I'm always searching for ways to make things better and finding growth areas. 
My previous experience in healthcare and social work sharpened my communication skills over the past 4 years. I anticipate needs before they are said out loud. I'm very presice at staying organized and maintaning strong connections. 
Demonstrating my skills effectively, I was promoted to a Financial Counselor after 3 months of joining the Financial Clearance Team at UW Medicine. I easily adapt to changes and embrace growth. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn new skills and welcome change as ways to elevate.
Feel free to add me on LinkedIn so we can collaborate and make a change together!
